The longest hand indicates the seconds, the longer one indicates the minutes while the smallest one indicates the hours.

The shortest hand indicates the hour, a longer hand indicates the minutes, and the longest arm indicates the seconds.
Analog clock shows time passing by moving hands continuously. The history and the origin of the clock is an interesting one, 
as it is hard to point which civilization invented it first. People would originally determine the time of the day by observing 
the length of their shadow. When the shadow was longest it meant that it was noon. Over centuries there have been sand dials,
water clocks, and other such clocks to tell the time. Once you can read the time, you can read a random analog clock and not
cross-check to see a digital clock.
